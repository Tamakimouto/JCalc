# GUI Mockup

Modify this document to include information about your GUI mockups. You should
upload your mockup images to an image hosting site (e.g., 
[imgur](http://imgur.com/)), and include them in this Markdown document with 
descriptions. Let the rest of this document serve as an example.

**Note:** If you view this <code>MOCKUP.md</code> file on GitHub, the Markdown
syntax will automatically be rendered so that it looks nice in your internet
browser. You need click on the <code>Raw</code> button in the upper
right-hand side of the document (when viewing on GitHub) in order to view the
plain text version of the document. This plain text view is the same thing
you will see when editing your <code>MOCKUP.md</code> file using Emacs
or Vi.

**Note:** For more information on Markdown syntax, see the
[Markdown Syntax Documentation](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) and the help page for 
[GitHub Flavored Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax).

## Main GUI

You can include your image, as follows:

![GUI Mockup 1](http://puu.sh/cEDbb/7809163239.png)

This is the calculator with the binary screen open.
On the actual project I'll make the buttons all the same size (relatively)
Have them all align properly,
and have it look better with the CSS.

## GUI with Bit Toggle

Here is another image...

![GUI Mockup 2](http://puu.sh/cEDqy/caa695d5be.png)

This mockup includes the binary bit toggle (Off). I designed this way because...
I based the design on the TI-8X's. I think it's pretty compact and easy to use.
for the window, I thihnk I can just set the frame visibility to false.  

## Additional Interface Elements

You can include additional sections to this document as needed.
